## Add book features or automatically convert to gitbook

Need to convert some high quality albums to gitbook and eventually publish
them.

## Add 'toc' sidebar for albums

Add the 'toc' sidebar for the book page, which belongs to an album, just match
the album title and the book title, if they are the same, list all of the posts
in the sidebar as the toc of that book.

Just need to add 'album' to the page header.

## Align _data/resources.yml with _data/sidebars.yml
